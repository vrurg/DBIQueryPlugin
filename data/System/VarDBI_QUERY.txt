---+++ DBI_QUERY -- make simple requests to a database.

Each query consist of two parts: a query statement (mostly is a =SELECT=
statement) and output formatting filters. SQL statement starts just after
the leading =%<nop>DBI_QUERY{...}%= declaration. The filters are defined by
=.header=, =.body=, and =.footer= keywords each starting at the beginning
of line.  Their meaning shall be obvious from their name:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|*Declaration*|*Description*|
|=.header=|It is prepended to the query output once.|
|=.body=|It is repeated for each row of data being fetched from the database.|
|=.footer=|It is appended to the query output.|

---++++ Parameters

|*Parameter*|*Description*|*Default*|*Required*|
|"db_identifier"|Database ID as defined in the plugin configuration. See [[DatabaseContrib#DatabaseConfig][DatabaseContrib configuration]] section.|_none_|required|
|subquery="name"|Defines a subquery which does not produce immediate result but could be used from inside another query -- see [[#DbiSubquery][%<nop>DBI_SUBQUERY%]]|_none_|optional|
|unquoted="col1 col2 ..."|List of columns to be left unquoted in the output. Read more in [[#ValueQuoting][Quoting of Values]] section.|_none_|optional|
|protected="col1 col2 ..."|List of columns to be protected from processing by Foswiki engine.|_none_|optional|

%I% A small note on =protected= parameter. Say, one has an arbitrary data
in a displayed column which could contain any kind of text strings. What
happens if such a string looks like a %WIKITOOLNAME% variable or macro? It's gonna be
expaded for sure. Adding a column to the =protected= list makes data from
this column displayed as is, unmodified.

#DbiSubquery
---++++ DBI_SUBQUERY -- call a %<nop>DBI_XXX% subquery

=%<nop>DBI_SUBQUERY{"name"}%= (aliased as =%<nop>DBI_EXEC%=) doesn't exist as a separate variable but only as a part of
header/body/footer processing mechanism. It's functionality is described in [[DBIQueryPlugin#VariableExpansion][Variable Expansion]]
and [[DBIQueryPlugin#Subqueries][Subqueries]] sections of DBIQueryPlugin documentation.
